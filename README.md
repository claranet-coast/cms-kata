### Description

Contained in this repo, there are some instructions for a new application that will go live in the next month!

You will need to:

1. Create a new git public GitHub (or similar services) repository and work there.

2. Automate the creation of the infrastructure and the setup of the Joomla application.

### Requirements

You have only these instructions:

1. It works on Ubuntu 18.04 or Centos 7

2. It's based on the last version of Joomla (it will be more useful if we can parameterize the version)

3. You can choose Apache, Nginx or whatever you want

3. Once deployed, the application should be:
	* Secure
	* Fast
	* Fault tolerant
	* Adaptive to average load

4. Backup the webserver logs with rotation of 7 days

5. Notification when more than 10 4xx requests are returned by application

6. Write a readme with instructions to install and try your solution

Make any assumptions that you need to. This is an opportunity to showcase your skills, so if you want to, implement the deployment process with any additional features, tools or techniques you'd like to.

We are evaluating solutions based on the architecture and quality of the deployment. Show us just how beautiful, clean and pragmatic your code can be.

Once your solution is ready, please send us the link of your project.
